UX - My goal was to create a website for viewers witha minimalist design giving them access to what would equate to my online resume.

Technologies - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Features - The most appealing feature I implemented into my website would have to be the bootstrap buttons that link to various social media websites and the contact form I created so that viewers would be able to ask me questions and get quotes on any potential jobs they want to hire me for.

Testing - The whole of my site was tested in-depth by myself, especially all of the links which I followed all the way through to make sure that they were linked properly for the viewers.

Deployment - The live website has been deployed to GitHub pages and is using the master branch.
    
Credits - I have given credit to Code Institute as I used the contact form from the previous resume project as a starting point for my own contact form. I also gave credit to a website as I used their picture of the avatar for my home page. Respective credits can be located on contact.html page and the style sheet in the index.html section.

Media - Relevant media has already been mentioned in the credits section above.
